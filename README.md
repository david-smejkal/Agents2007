## Vanilla v0.9.0 release

This project is put on GitHub (in its vanilla state v0.9.0) as it was delivered back in 2007.<br />
It was a collaborative work of four developers and so some parts haven't been fully translated to English.

I'll be polishing it in the near future to work towards a fully translated and documented v1.0.0 release.
